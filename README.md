# Copy Contents with Paths

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to easily copy the contents of selected files along with their relative paths. It's particularly useful for sharing code snippets or entire project structures with others, including AI assistants.

## Features

- Copy contents and paths of multiple selected files in the explorer
- Copy content of a single selected file in the explorer
- Copy content of the currently open file in the editor
- Copy contents of all files in the workspace when no specific files are selected

## Usage

1. Select one or more files in the VS Code explorer
2. Right-click and choose "‚≠ê Copy Contents with Paths" from the context menu
3. The contents and paths of the selected files will be copied to your clipboard

Alternatively, you can use the command palette:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS)
2. Search for "Copy Contents with Paths" and select it

If no files are selected and no editor is active, the extension will copy the contents of all files in your workspace (excluding node_modules).

## Installation

2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for "Copy Contents with Paths"
